To use this addon, you need to go to the shipping method and activate the "allow commitment date" option.
Then, you can configure various settings right there. Afterward,
go to the cart in the e-commerce platform, and you will see that if you select that shipping method,
the option to choose the delivery day will appear.
When using a shipping method that requires specifying the delivery date,
the button will not appear until a date is selected.
