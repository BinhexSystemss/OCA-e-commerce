This addon allows selecting the delivery date when purchasing from the e-commerce platform,
configuring excluded days of the week, minimum or maximum days to limit the selection
from the current date. All of this is configurable from the shipping method.

Usage
=====


To use this addon, you need to go to the shipping method and activate the "allow commitment date" option.
Then, you can configure various settings right there. Afterward,
go to the cart in the e-commerce platform, and you will see that if you select that shipping method,
the option to choose the delivery day will appear.
When using a shipping method that requires specifying the delivery date,
the button will not appear until a date is selected.
